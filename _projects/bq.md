Bayesian quadrature is a model-based approach to numerical integration similar to how 
Bayesian optimization is a model-based approach to global optimization. 
It is especially efficient for low-dimensional integrals.

Bayesian quadrature is a [probabilistic numerical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_numerics#Integration) 
method as it yields a posterior over the integral value, possibly a richer quantity than a point estimate.
