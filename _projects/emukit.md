I am one of the original authors and co-maintainer of the 
[EmuKit](https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit) Python library. 

EmuKit is a highly adaptable Python toolkit for decision-making under uncertainty. Its core components is an 
active learning loop that unifies several active machine learning methods such as experimental design, 
Bayesian optimization and Bayesian quadrature. 
EmuKit's design allows the user to customize the learning algorithm easily, 
by switching out or adding new components (plug-and-play). 
Further, EmuKit provides an interface for the surrogate model, such that custom models can be integrated into
the code quickly. Read more on EmuKit's structure 
[here](https://emukit.github.io/about/) or check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit).
