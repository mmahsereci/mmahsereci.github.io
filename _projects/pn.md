title: probabilistic numerics
description: >
  Probabilistic numerics is a scientific field at the intersection of statistics, machine learning 
  and applied mathematics, where tasks in numerical analysis are seen as problems of statistical, 
  probabilistic, or Bayesian inference.

[Probabilistic numerics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_numerics) (PN) is the overarching research topic I am interested in. Sub-topics I have worked on
are high-dimensional stochastic optimization for non-convex continuous functions, ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers 
and integration routines (quadrature).
The general idea of PN is that the numerical quantity of interest is seen as a latent variable that is to be inferred.
