title: Probabilistic numerics
description: >
  Probabilistic numerics is a scientific field at the intersection of statistics, machine learning 
  and applied mathematics, where tasks in numerical analysis are seen as problems of statistical, 
  probabilistic, or Bayesian inference.

[Probabilistic numerics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_numerics) (PN) 
is concerned with solving numerical tasks using probabilistic inference. 
This includes (stochastic) optimization, ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers, 
integration routines (quadrature) and others.
The general idea of PN is that the numerical quantity of interest is seen as a latent variable that is to be inferred.
