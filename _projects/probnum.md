ProbNum provides numerical solvers for linear systems, differential equations, integrals and linear systems in Python.
The solvers not only estimate the solution of the numerical problem, but also its numerical error which 
arises from finite computational resources, discretization and stochastic input. 
The return objects are usually distributions over the solution which can be used in downstream decisions.

I am an active contributor and maintainer of ProbNum.
