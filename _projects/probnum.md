I am a contributor and maintainer of the [ProbNum](https://github.com/probabilistic-numerics/probnum) Python library.

ProbNum provides numerical solvers for linear systems, intractable integrals and ordinary differential equations.
ProbNum's solvers not only estimate the solution of the numerical problem, but also its uncertainty (numerical error) which 
arises from finite computational resources, discretization and stochastic input. 
The estimated numerical uncertainty can be used in downstream decisions.

Lower level structure of ProbNum includes: A module for random variables and random variable arithmetics;
(memory-)efficient and lazy implementation of linear operators that integrate with random variables;
filtering and smoothing for probabilistic state-space models, mostly variants of Kalman filters.
