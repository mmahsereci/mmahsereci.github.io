I was involved in several aspects of stochastic optimization, such as line-searches, 
filtering for noise-reduced search directions, generalization and overfitting, and dynamic pruning during network training.
There are two related questions: How do we design better optimizers? And, what does better even mean?
Further, the model, the optimization landscape and the data interact, and it is unclear yet how to best retrieve 
and use the information contained in optimization steps to simultaneously solve related tasks
such as the ones mentioned.

Some aspects of stochastic optimization can be seen as methods of
[probabilistic numerics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_numerics).
