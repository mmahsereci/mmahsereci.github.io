I am a postdoctoral researcher at the
<a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/methoden-des-maschinellen-lernens/personen/">
  University of T&uuml;bingen.

Previously I have been at Amazon Web Services (AWS) Berlin and
Amazon Retail (AMZN) Cambridge as Machine Learning Scientist. I graduated from
the Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI) T&uuml;bingen.

My research interests are 
stochastic optimization, 
probabilistic numerics,
numerical integration and 
statistical emulation. 
I am also an active contributor and maintainer of open source software projects on GitHub.
